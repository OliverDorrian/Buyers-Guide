                As travel begins to resume with less restrictions and people gain more confidence to carry on “business
                as usual” in the new normal, the Cayman Islands continues to flourish as an attractive destination for
                global property investors.
              </p>
              <p>
                On top of its breathtaking vistas and sophisticated, yet laidback island lifestyle, the Cayman Islands
                is widely known for its highly appealing government incentives such as property tax exemptions and
                residency by investment programs, as well as a “safety first” policy that has made it one of the most secure
                destinations in a world struggling with a pandemic.
              </p>
              <p>
                Despite a prolonged lockdown, Cayman continued to hold its position as one of the top luxury real estate
                markets in the world — a position affirmed by its record-breaking revenue of $1.43 billion dollars in
                2021.
              </p>
              <p>
                “Generally speaking, the Cayman Islands has always made it attractive to buy property here – hence our
                ongoing real estate and investment boom,” says ERA Cayman associate broker and sales agent, John
                Pohlmann.

          <h1>Don’t miss out on pre-selling real estate perks</h1>
          <p>
            Whether intended for use as private residences or as vehicles for investment, the local real estate industry
            continues to expect an upsurge on the already skyrocketing demand for prime Cayman property.
          </p>
          <p>
            Amid the mad rush to purchase and the rapidly dwindling inventory, particularly on luxury real estate, John
            says interested buyers can still land some excellent deals by taking advantage of pre-selling offers.
          </p>
          <p>
            “New developments often sell pre-construction property at lower prices,” he points out. “Typically, this is
            done by steadily increasing the prices of the property as inventory shrinks and construction milestones are reached.
            New property built here will almost assuredly cost more and be worth more at completion versus the
            preconstruction phases.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Buying below market price is a long-term investment strategy that makes pre-construction purchases extremely
            viable. For instance, at the Grand Hyatt Grand Cayman Hotel & Residences on Seven Mile Beach, condominium units are
            pre-selling at an average of only US$1,400 per square foot, presenting an immense opportunity for capital appreciation over
            time.
